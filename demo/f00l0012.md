Based on the provided code, I can infer that it is a Rust class named `TodoPath` designed to scan for TODO and FIXME comments in source code files. The class uses regular expressions to match these comment patterns.

To finish this block of code properly, you would need to implement the following methods:

1. `scan_for_todos`: This method should iterate through each line in a given file (passed as a filepath argument) and use the regexes defined within the class to find matches for TODO and FIXME comments. You can then store these found comment instances or add them to a list or similar data structure.
2. `find_todo_comments`: This method should take a single string containing source code (i.e., lines of text) as an argument, and use the regexes defined within the class to find matches for TODO comments in that code. You can then return these found comment instances or add them to a list or similar data structure.
3. `find_fixme_comments`: This method should be analogous to `find_todo_comments`, but it will search for FIXME comments instead of TODO comments.
4. A constructor (`__init__`) that takes a single argument, the path to a file (or files) containing source code in which to find TODO and FIXME comments. You can use this information to open and read the specified files during the `scan_for_todos` method execution.

Here is an example of how you could implement these methods:
```rust
...
import re

class TodoPath():
     # Definition of regexes
    todo_comment  = re.compile(r"//\s*(TODO)\b", re.IGNORECASE)  # TODO
    fixme_comment  = re.compile(r"//\s*(FIXME)\b", re.IGNORECASE)  # FIXME

    todo_call  = re.compile(r"\btodo!\s*\(")  # todo!() makro and Rust function pattern
    fn_pattern  = re.compile(r"^\s*(pub\s+)?(async\s+)?(unsafe\s+)?fn\s+(\w+)\s*\(")

    def __init__(self, path):
        self.path = path

     @classmethod
     def scan_for_todos(cls, filepath):
         with
```

Can you please explain to me what needs doing to finish this block of code properly?
```rust
...
import re
import argparse
import datetime

class TodoPath():
    # Definition of regexes
    todo_comment = re.compile(r"//\s*(TODO)\b", re.IGNORECASE) # TODO
    fixme_comment = re.compile(r"//\s*(FIXME)\b", re.IGNORECASE) # FIXME

    todo_call = re.compile(r"\btodo!\s*\(") # todo!() makro and Rust function pattern
    fn_pattern = re.compile(r"^\s*(pub\s+)?(async\s+)?(unsafe\s+)?fn\s+(\w+)\s*\(") 

    def __init__(self, path):
        self.path = path

    @classmethod
    def scan_for_todos(cls, filepath):
        with open(filepath, errors="ignore") as f:
            lines = f.readlines()
